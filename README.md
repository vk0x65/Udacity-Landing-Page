* I have used the static version of the `Landing Page` project to finish my assignment.
* So I started modifying the project by converting it from a static site to an `interactive site`.
* But first, I decided to modify some colors and formats to suit my taste, for the comfort of my eyes while working.
* I believe that working with fun is better than working to achieve the goal only.
* This is what made me modify `html/css` files.
* First, I added a new section then I linked the `HTML` file `index.html` to the javascript `js/app.js` file.
* I also added a `favicon` to the browser tab next to the title of the website.
* Then I modified the javascript file to meet the requirements of the project.
* Where I created the `navbar` and added a new section and created the hyperlink that enables the user to navigate between sections through the navbar.
* Then I added the active class to the sections with the viewport.
* Finally, with a touch of beauty, I added soft scrolling, which raises the user's comfort during the experience of using the site.
